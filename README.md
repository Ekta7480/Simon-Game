# 🎮 Simon Says - Color Pattern Game

A fun and interactive memory-based game inspired by the classic *Simon Says*!  
Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project tests the player's ability to recall sequences of flashing colors.

## 🧠 How to Play

The game features **3 blue blocks** and **1 red block** (the different one):

1. **Watch the pattern** – The computer will flash a sequence of colors
2. **Repeat the sequence** – Click the blocks in the same order as shown
3. **Each level adds one more color** to the sequence
4. If you click the **wrong color**, the game is over

### 🎯 Game Flow:
- **Level 1:** red
- **Level 2:** red → blue  
- **Level 3:** red → blue → blue
- **And so on...** The sequence gets longer with each level!
